# JavaProject
Welcome to this respository, it contains all the small projects I made during the learning period.
Feel free to use the source code if you want.

How to use:

Files that has .java in the end was the source code.
Files that has .jar in the ned was the finished application.
* Must have java enviroment downloaded on your device.

<b><u>Steps to run the jar:</u></b>
1. Download it to your local device
2. Open Terminal, Cmd, or console based on your OS
3. Use "cd" command to go to the place you saved it at
4. Type in | java -jar (file name).jar |
5. Have fun using it!
